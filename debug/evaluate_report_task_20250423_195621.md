**Evaluation Summary**

| Metric | Score | Notes |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| Coverage | 1/5 | Several key sections are incomplete or missing entirely, marked "[To be added]". The overview lacks summaries, and transportation, accommodation, and destination guide sections are placeholders. The Weather & Packing section is the most complete. |
| Factual Consistency | 4/5 | The weather information seems reasonable based on general knowledge of Paris in May. The packing list aligns with the weather description.  However, no specific facts are cited, making a perfect score impossible. |
| Readability | 3/5 | The document is generally well-structured with clear headings and subheadings. The packing list is easy to follow. However, the numerous "[To be added]" sections disrupt the flow. |
| Actionability | 2/5 | The weather and packing list provide actionable advice. However, the lack of detail in other sections (transportation, accommodation, attractions, dining) significantly reduces the plan's usability. |
| Style / Tone | 4/5 | The writing style is clear, engaging, and generally traveller-friendly. The tone is helpful and informative. |

**Total:** 14 / 25
