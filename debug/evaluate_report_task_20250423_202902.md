Evaluation Summary
| Metric | Score | Notes |
| ------ | ----- | ----- |
| Coverage | 4/5 | Most sections are present, but a dedicated "Accommodation" section is missing, and the dining section is underdeveloped. |
| Factual Consistency | 4/5 | Information generally aligns with expected travel data. Weather data added. |
| Readability | 4/5 | Good structure with clear headings, but some sections could be more concise. |
| Actionability | 3/5 | The transportation details are useful. However, accommodation and dining recommendations are too vague to be truly actionable. |
| Style / Tone | 4/5 | The tone is generally appropriate, but some sentences could be more engaging. |

**Total:** 19 / 25

**Top Fixes**
   1. Add a dedicated "Accommodation" section with specific hotel recommendations and price ranges.
   2. Expand the "Dining" section with restaurant suggestions, price ranges, and cuisine types.
   3. Provide more specific attraction recommendations, including opening hours and ticket information.

**Items to Verify**
   • The current weather data for May 23, 2025 shows overcast clouds and a temperature around 10°C. This contrasts with the statement that Paris experiences "mild" weather in May, and needs adjusting to provide more accurate packing recommendations.
