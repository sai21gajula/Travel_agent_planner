**Top Fixes**
1. Add a dedicated section on Local Cuisine, including specific restaurant recommendations and must-try dishes.
2. Include a weather forecast for the trip dates and a corresponding packing list with specific clothing suggestions.
3. Provide more actionable details on transportation, such as where to purchase the Navigo Découverte pass and estimated costs.
4. Enhance the writing style with more descriptive language and engaging anecdotes to capture the essence of Paris.
5. Incorporate interesting facts and cultural insights to enrich the travel experience.

**Items to Verify**
• Cost-effectiveness of RER B train vs. other airport transfer options.
• "Peak season" dates and corresponding accommodation pricing.
• Opening status of Notre Dame Cathedral (still under renovation in May 2025?).
