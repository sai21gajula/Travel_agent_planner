**Transportation Options between New York and Atlanta (2025-05-23 to 2025-05-30)**

Given the issues with accessing real-time data from the available tools, I will provide a general overview of transportation options based on my existing knowledge.

**1) Flight Options:**

*   **Airlines:** Several major airlines operate direct flights between New York City (JFK, LGA, EWR) and Atlanta (ATL), including Delta, United, American, JetBlue, and Southwest.
*   **Estimated Prices:** Round-trip flights typically range from \$200 to \$600, depending on the airline, time of booking, and demand. Prices tend to be higher during peak travel seasons.
*   **Flight Duration:** Direct flights take approximately 2 hours. Flights with one or more stops can take significantly longer (4-6+ hours).

*   **General Schedules:** Flights are available throughout the day, with higher frequency during morning and evening peak travel times.
*   **Airport Transportation (Atlanta):** Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) is accessible via the MARTA (Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority) rail system. The airport station is located inside the domestic terminal. Taxis, ride-sharing services (Uber, Lyft), and airport shuttles are also readily available.

**2) Local Public Transit (Atlanta):**

*   **Available Types:** Atlanta's primary public transportation system is MARTA, which includes both rail and bus services.
    *   **Rail:** MARTA operates four rail lines (Red, Gold, Blue, and Green) that connect key areas of the city, including downtown, Midtown, Buckhead, and the airport.
    *   **Bus:** MARTA also operates an extensive bus network that covers a wide range of areas not directly served by the rail system.
*   **Key Routes for Tourists:**
    *   **Airport to Downtown/Midtown:** The Red and Gold lines connect the airport to downtown and Midtown.
    *   **Downtown Attractions:** Many downtown attractions are within walking distance of MARTA stations or accessible by bus.
*   **Transit Pass Options:**
    *   **Breeze Card:** A reloadable card that can be used on both rail and bus services.
    *   **Single-Ride Tickets:** Available for individual trips.
    *   **Day/Week Passes:** Provide unlimited rides for a set period.
*   **Approximate Costs:** Single-ride tickets are typically around \$2.50. Day passes are approximately \$9.
*   **Operating Hours:** MARTA rail generally operates from approximately 5:00 AM to 1:00 AM on weekdays and slightly later on weekends. Bus service hours vary by route.
*   **Frequency:** Rail service frequency varies depending on the line and time of day, but trains generally run every 10-20 minutes during peak hours. Bus frequency also varies by route.

**3) Regional Transportation:**

*   **Train (Amtrak):** Amtrak operates the Crescent line, which connects New York City and Atlanta. The journey is long (approximately 17-20 hours) but can be a scenic alternative to flying. Schedules are limited, with typically one train per day in each direction.
*   **Bus (Greyhound, FlixBus):** Several bus companies offer service between New York and Atlanta. The journey is very long (20+ hours) and can be less comfortable than flying or taking the train, but it is often the most affordable option. Multiple departures are available daily.
