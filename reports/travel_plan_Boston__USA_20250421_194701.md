## Local Guide

### Brief History & Fun Facts:

Boston, founded in 1630 by English Puritan settlers, is one of the oldest cities in the United States. Named after Boston, Lincolnshire in England, it quickly became a vital political, commercial, and religious center. The city played a pivotal role in the American Revolution, witnessing events like the Boston Massacre and the Boston Tea Party. The Siege of Boston forced the British to evacuate in 1776.

Boston is known by many nicknames, including "Beantown" and "Cradle of Liberty." It boasts many firsts, including the first public park (Boston Common, 1634), the first public school (Boston Latin School, 1635), and the first subway system (Tremont Street Subway, 1897). Today, Boston is a global leader in higher education, research, and biotechnology, and is considered a hub for innovation and entrepreneurship.
