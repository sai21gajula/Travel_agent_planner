### Local Guide

#### 1. Brief History & Fun Facts:

Boston, founded in 1630 by English Puritan settlers, is one of the oldest cities in the United States. Named after Boston in Lincolnshire, England, it quickly became a vital political, commercial, and cultural center. The city played a pivotal role in the American Revolution, witnessing events like the Boston Massacre and the Boston Tea Party. Interestingly, Boston boasts several "firsts" in American history, including the first public park (Boston Common, 1634), the first public school (Boston Latin School, 1635), and the first subway system (Tremont Street subway, 1897).

Today, Boston is a global leader in higher education, research, and biotechnology, home to nearly 5,000 startup companies. The city's economy is driven by finance, technology, and government, with Bostonians demonstrating the highest average rate of philanthropy in the nation.
