## 1. Transportation (Public Transit)

**Note:** Due to an issue with the Transitland API, I was unable to retrieve real-time public transportation route information. Therefore, the following information is based on general knowledge of the Paris public transport system.

Paris has an extensive public transportation system, including the Métro (subway), RER (regional express network), buses, and trams.

Paris boasts a rich history dating back to 8000 BC. The Parisii tribe settled on the Seine around 250 BC, later conquered by the Romans who established Lutetia. Clovis I, King of the Franks, made Paris his capital in 508 AD. The city flourished during the Middle Ages as a religious and commercial hub, giving birth to Gothic architecture and the University of Paris. It endured plagues and wars, eventually becoming a center of enlightenment in the 18th century and the stage for the French Revolution.

Known as the "City of Light" since the 19th century due to its pioneering street lighting and its central role in arts and sciences, Paris is a global hub for finance, diplomacy, commerce, culture, fashion, and gastronomy. As of January 2023, the Paris Region had a population of over 12 million, representing about 19% of the French population.
