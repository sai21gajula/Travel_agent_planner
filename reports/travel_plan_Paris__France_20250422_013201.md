### 4.1 Brief History & Fun Facts:

Paris boasts a rich history dating back to 8000 BC with the earliest traces of human occupation. The Parisii tribe settled on the banks of the Seine around 250-225 BC, establishing a fortified settlement and trading hub. In 52 BC, the Romans conquered the area, founding Lutetia. Clovis I, King of the Franks, made Paris his capital in 508 AD. Throughout the Middle Ages, Paris flourished as a major European city, renowned for its Gothic architecture and the prestigious University of Paris. The city faced hardships during the Bubonic Plague and the Hundred Years' War.

Since the 17th century, Paris has stood as a global center for finance, diplomacy, culture, fashion and gastronomy, and was dubbed the "City of Light" in the 19th century due to its prominence in the arts and sciences and its pioneering use of street lighting. The city and its surrounding region remain a major hub within Europe, with a population of over 12 million people. Iconic landmarks include the Louvre, Notre Dame Cathedral, the Eiffel Tower, and the historical district along the Seine, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Paris is home to international organizations such as UNESCO, and it hosts major sporting events like the French Open and the Summer Olympics.
